Hello there.


I've always wanted to have a blog online (knowing full well readership would be in the single digits), so here we are! I also didn't want to use medium / whatever blogging platform is the current flavor of the month just as a matter of personal preference. sorry.


this blog / website is set up using a combination of github pages for hosting and jekyll as the site generation engine. i might do a writeup of that process at some point down the line, but there are plenty of tutorials for how to do that online, so i probably won't.
